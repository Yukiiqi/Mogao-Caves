          ðŸŒŸThe Mogao Caves are renowned for their abundant collection of
          statues and murals that span 1,000 years of Buddhist art. Home to
          45,000 square meters of frescoes and more than 2,000 painted
          sculptures, the site holds great historical and religious value.

          ðŸŒŸThe giant statue represent Maitreya Buddha in cave 96, at 35.5 m
          high, which was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu
          Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and
          giant statues in 694. It was damaged in an earthquake and had been
          repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing,
          colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its
          original Early Tang appearance. It is now housed in a prominent wooden
          9-storey structure.

          ðŸŒŸCave 17 discovered by Chinese Taoist Wang Yuanlu came to be known as
          the Library Cave. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002
          were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles
          of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were
          also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts. The Library Cave also
          contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of
          Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia.

            ðŸŒŸThe visual center is the FlyingApsaras with six arms, referring to
            the six-arm-FlyingApsaras of Tang Dynasty located in Cave 148. The
            Flying Apsaras, or Feitian in Mandarin, are often considered a
            symbol of the Mogao Grottoes. She has two hands playing the Pipa,
            one hand ringing brass bell, another hand holding the first Magazine
            for Mogao Caves

            âœ¨When 40 people visit the cave for half an hour, the carbon dioxide
            in the cave rises fivefold which erodes the fresco.
            <br />
            âœ¨This is my imagination of the future: VR technology may make Mogao
            Caves digitally immortal: people can use VR at home to visit Mogao
            Caves, even through the simulation means to touch the stone wall,
            interact with people inside the fresco, and communicate with
            generations of Mogao guardians.
            <br />
            âœ¨VR technology will largely alleviate the burden on Mogao Caves by
            reducing the number of tourists, enabling the of Mogao Caves
            preserve a little longer and longer...
